# Settings Page

By default the settings page uses contains a single boolean setting to track whether the app should be displayed with the Light or Dark theme.

You can add additional settings by following the instructions below.  Note there are separate instructions if you are using [MVVM Basic / MVVM Light](#mvvm) or [Code Behind](#cb).

## <a name="mvvm"></a>Add another boolean setting (MVVM Basic or MVVM Light)

Let's add a boolean setting to control whether errors should be automatically reported.
Adding a setting requires you to:

* Update the View so it's possible to see and change the setting
* Update the ViewModel to add logic related to changing the setting.

### Update the View

The default code uses a `ToggleSwitch` to control the theme. It's possible to use another `ToggleSwitch` for our new setting but we'll use a `CheckBox` to show an alternative.

Add the following below the `ToggleSwitch` inside the `StackPanel` in **SettingsView.xaml**.

```xml
<CheckBox IsChecked="{x:Bind ViewModel.IsAutoErrorReportingEnabled, Mode=TwoWay}"
          x:Uid="Settings_EnableAutoErrorReporting"
          Margin="0,8,0,0" />
```

Add an entry to **Strings/en-us/Resources.resw**

Name: Settings_EnableAutoErrorReporting.Content  
Value: Automatically report errors

When run it will now look like this:

But if you try and run it now you will get build errors as the ViewModel hasn't been updated to add the new property.

### Update the ViewModel

The `IsLightThemeEnabled` property uses a static `ThemeSelectorService`. It is not necessary to create equivalent services for every setting but is appropriate for the theme preference as this is needed when the app launches.

Because we may want to access settings in various parts of the app it's important that the same settings values are used in all locations. The simplest way to do this is to have a single instance of the `SettingsViewModel` and use it for all access to settings values.

The generated code in includes a Singleton helper class to provide access to a single instance of the view model which we can use everywhere.

With this knowledge we can now add the new property for accessing our stored setting. We also need to add a new, awaitable initializer for the property too.
Add the following to **SettingsViewModel.cs**

```csharp
private bool? _isAutomaticErrorReportingEnabled;

public bool? IsAutoErrorReportingEnabled
{
    get => _isAutomaticErrorReportingEnabled ?? false;

    set
    {
        if (value != _isAutomaticErrorReportingEnabled)
        {
            Task.Run(async () => await Windows.Storage.ApplicationData.Current.LocalSettings.SaveAsync(nameof(IsAutoErrorReportingEnabled), value ?? false));
        }

        Set(ref _isAutomaticErrorReportingEnabled, value);
    }
}

private bool _hasInstanceBeenInitialized = false;

public async Task EnsureInstanceInitialized()
{
    if (!_hasInstanceBeenInitialized)
    {
        _hasInstanceBeenInitialized = true;

        IsAutoErrorReportingEnabled =
            await Windows.Storage.ApplicationData.Current.LocalSettings.ReadAsync<bool>(nameof(IsAutoErrorReportingEnabled));

        Initialize();
    }
}
```

We must now update our uses of the ViewModel. In **SettingsView.xaml.cs** change the property declaration from this:

```csharp
public SettingsViewModel ViewModel { get; } = new SettingsViewModel();
```

to this:

```csharp
public SettingsViewModel ViewModel { get; } = Singleton<SettingsViewModel>.Instance;
```

so it uses the single instance.

Then change the `OnNavigatedTo()` method so that instead of calling the old Initialize method, like this:

```csharp
protected override void OnNavigatedTo(NavigationEventArgs e)
{
    ViewModel.Initialize();
}
```

It now awaits the call to the new Initializer like this:

```csharp
protected override async void OnNavigatedTo(NavigationEventArgs e)
{
    await Singleton<SettingsViewModel>.Instance.EnsureInstanceInitialized();
}
```

Everything is now complete and you can run the app and it will remember the value between invocations of the app.

### Accessing the setting from elsewhere in the app

If you want to access the property elsewhere in the app, ensure you have called `await Singleton<SettingsViewModel>.Instance.EnsureInstanceInitialized();`. Then you can get or set the property with `Singleton<SettingsViewModel>.Instance.IsAutoErrorReportingEnabled`.
For example:

```csharp
try
{
    ...
}
catch (Exception exc)
{
    await Singleton<SettingsViewModel>.Instance.EnsureInstanceInitialized();
    if (Singleton<SettingsViewModel>.Instance.IsAutoErrorReportingEnabled)
    {
        // Send the error details to the server
    }
}
```

If you only use the value in one or two places you could call `EnsureInstanceInitialized()` each time before you access `Singleton<SettingsViewModel>.Instance`. But, as `EnsureInstanceInitialized()` only needs to be called once before it is used, if you have lots of settings or need to access them in many places you could call it once as part of the `InitializeAsync()` method in **ActivationService.cs**.

## <a name="cb"></a>Add another boolean setting (Code Behind)

Add the following below the `ToggleSwitch` inside the `StackPanel` in **SettingsView.xaml**

```xml
<CheckBox IsChecked="{x:Bind IsAutoErrorReportingEnabled, Mode=OneWay}"
          x:Uid="Settings_EnableAutoErrorReporting"
          Checked="CheckBoxChecked"
          Unchecked="CheckBoxUnchecked"
          Margin="0,8,0,0" />
```

Add an entry to **Strings/en-us/Resources.resw**

Name: Settings_EnableAutoErrorReporting.Content
Value: Automatically report errors

When run it will now look like this:

![](../resources/modifications/Settings_added_checkbox.png)

But if you try and run it now you will get build errors as the code behind file hasn't been updated to add the new property and event handlers.

### Update the code behind file

In **SettingsPage.xaml.cs**, change the `OnNavigatedTo` method to be like this

```csharp
protected override async void OnNavigatedTo(NavigationEventArgs e)
{
    AppDescription = GetAppDescription();
    IsAutoErrorReportingEnabled = await Windows.Storage.ApplicationData.Current.LocalSettings.ReadAsync<bool>(nameof(IsAutoErrorReportingEnabled));
}
```

also add the following to **SettingsPage.xaml.cs**.

```csharp
private bool _isAutoErrorReportingEnabled;
public bool IsAutoErrorReportingEnabled
{
    get { return _isAutoErrorReportingEnabled; }
    set { Set(ref _isAutoErrorReportingEnabled, value); }
}

private async void CheckBoxChecked(object sender, Windows.UI.Xaml.RoutedEventArgs e)
{
        await Windows.Storage.ApplicationData.Current.LocalSettings.SaveAsync(nameof(IsAutoErrorReportingEnabled), true);
}

private async void CheckBoxUnchecked(object sender, Windows.UI.Xaml.RoutedEventArgs e)
{
    await Windows.Storage.ApplicationData.Current.LocalSettings.SaveAsync(nameof(IsAutoErrorReportingEnabled), false);
}
```

### Accessing the setting from elsewhere in the app

If you want to access the property elsewhere in the app, the easiest way to do this is to read the setting directly. The code below reads the value into a variable called `isEnabled` which you can then query as needed.

```csharp
var isEnabled = await Helpers.SettingsStorageExtensions.ReadAsync<bool>(Windows.Storage.ApplicationData.Current.LocalSettings, "IsAutoErrorReportingEnabled");
```
