## WinUI 3 Desktop Apps

We're looking into adding WinUI 3 Desktop App templates to Windows Template Studio.

Our templates for WinUI 3 Desktop Apps are currently in preview as WinUI3 itself. You can try them out in our [dev-nightly version](./../getting-started-extension.md#nightly--pre-release-feeds-for-windows-template-studio).

We would love to get your feedback on our [tracking issue for WinUI3 templates](https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsTemplateStudio/issues/3810).
