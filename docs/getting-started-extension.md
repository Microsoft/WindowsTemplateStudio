## Nightly / Pre-release instructions

The Pre-release build version allows you to get updates with stable features not officially released yet (so, they are not definitive and may change).

This feed will have stable extension versions so it is not thought to have breaking changes (and can be installed side by side with the official one), anyway, installing this extension is at your own risk.

Open Visual Studio 2017 and go to **Tools -> Extensions & Updates**, then click on **Change your Extensions and Updates settings** and create an Additional Extension Gallery.
